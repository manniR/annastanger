 # Paintings entry template
 # -------------------
 #
 # This template gets loaded whenever a Paintings entry’s URL is
 # requested. That’s because the Paintings section’s Template setting is
 # set to “Paintings/_entry”, the path to this template.
 #
 # When this template is loaded, it will already have an ‘entry’
 # variable, set to the requested Paintings entry.
 #
